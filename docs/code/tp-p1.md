# ThinkPad P1

Sometimes there's an electronic or mechanical product that has just the right mix of functionality, clean design, durable construction, and lots of fun fiddly bits to keep my gearhead side distracted after the novelty of a new gadget wears off.

I've had a handful of cameras over the years that ticked all these boxes, and building desktop and server PCs likewise has the right mix of tinkering and creative enablement to be an evergreen hobby.

For my "daily driver" laptop computers, though, I more or less resigned myself years ago to the fact that most machines I ever used would be a sealed, un-serviceable sliver of inscrutable tech. If you're committed to OS X, that is indeed pretty much your only option, and it's increasingly the way most Windows laptops are built: slim, glued-together, and impossible to upgrade or meaningfully repair unless you ship it back to the manufacturer.

And then, out there in "priced so only a corporate spreadsheet can justify the premium" land there are some outliers in the form of "professional" and "mobile workstation" laptops. Some still incorporate archaic components like user-replaceable batteries and storage, and fewer still can be opened up without proprietary driver bits, heat guns, and carefully-torqued spudgers and picks.

Just on the "thin and light" side of this pool of serviceable laptops is the ThinkPad X1 Extreme/P1 series. They're basically the same machine, configured with consumer or "pro" graphics cards respectively. ("Pro" cards in this context are usually slower than their gaming counterparts, but have optimized, verified driver support for CAD/CAM, medical imaging, and other high-end 3D applications.)

I snagged a P1 model for about $1000, which is arguably spendy for a "thin and light" Windows laptop with a plain-old 1080p display and not-so-amazing battery life, but what I actually ended up is something kind of special. The specs don't look amazing on paper, but they add up to a fast, highly-upgradeable machine I fully expect to still be using in 4-5 years.

The keyboard is great of course (b/c ThinkPad) which is actually kind of a big deal if you've been following the saga of Apple keyboards in recent years. The screen is just fine, but I intentionally got the most basic display to taking the hit to battery life and out-of-the-box UI scaling that comes from 4k+ resolution on a laptop-sized panel.

Six fast 9th-gen Intel cores are honestly plenty for anything I'm gonna do on the road, and the ability to just pop in new RAM, SSDs, and even networking cards as time goes on honestly feels magical after years of agnozing over the initial configuration of a new machine, knowing I'd never have more memory or storage on-board. There are even ports other than USB-C! I've got honest-to-god HDMI, USB-A, and a full-sized SD card reader.

It runs Linux like a champ of course, handles fairly modern games at full 1080p, and did I mention I can open it up to add RAM or a second SSD in about 15 seconds with a Philips head screwdriver?

And yet the whole thing is lighter and about 1/2 the cost of my new work machine (16" MBP). Yes, it's a bit thicker. No, the display doesn't do 110% of sRGB at crazy-high resolutions, and the trackpad isn't larger than my quite large smartphone.

I'm happy to take these tradeoffs in service of being able to repair and upgrade the machine in the coming years. The design might have been originally intended to make large-scale corporate deployments easier for IT departments -- got a dead laptop and a big deadline coming up? Swing by the IT desk and they can drop your system drive in an identical loaner and have you back up and running inside of an hour -- but it translates just fine to long-term hobbyist ownership and upkeep.
