This site came about because I spent quite a few months not working and taking care of myself and my family after a long stint in high-pressure startup-y jobs. During that time I came back to programming as a creative and intellectual outlet, rather than simply a means of making a living, and found it very much to my liking.

I've come across some really great ideas in that time: dWeb tech, off-the-grid connectivity, trustworthy and resilient communications, and others. I've added a few topics of my own to that queue and picked up a few useful new tools in the ol' programming toolbox[^1] and scribbled a lot of notes.

I'm going to try to collect some of those links, scribblings, and unfinished bits of code into a public notebook of sorts here.
