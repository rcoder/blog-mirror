# About Put The Leaves In (ptli.club)

> *Note*: This is not describing a real site, though it may become one! I share it as an example of the number of things I worry about before trying to build a simple little website these days.

## What is ptli.club?

This is a social network for one purpose: sharing a meal with family and friends. You could be inviting a group of work friends over for a backyard BBQ, hosting a potluck brunch with other families from your kid's school, or planning an elaborate holiday meal; in any case, you need to know who's coming, what they're bringing, and who needs the oven at 30 minutes before "go time".

## How Can I Use It?

To start, create a new "place" to have your event. We'll give you a "secret" name and link that other people can use to join, but you get to pick the name that will be shared with everyone you invite.

Your name can reference a real place (like "Sam's House") with a geotag or a gathering that roams from location to location ("Pescatarian Teetotaler Pthursdays"). You'll also need to give instructions for how to find this event if you aren't including a geotag. ("Posted in Notes" or "emailed to private list" is fine as an explanation here.)

Next, pick a time for the gathering. We know this is hard. If you need to pick between several different times, you can create multiple invites and see which one gets the most votes. Alternately, mark the time as "flexible" and let folks sign up and comment with preferences, then mark it as "fixed" when you're ready to nail down specifics, set reminders, etc.

Next, you have two likely choices for a next step. If this is a communal meal with many specific dishes or supplies that you need to make sure are provided, you can start with the Menu tab. If you prefer to focus on who's coming and work out the menu later, choose Who.

Under Menu, you'll find tools to record what dishes are being prepared or asked for, who's bringing them, and what other resources they'll need (serving utensils or dishes, oven or microwave time, etc.).

Who lists the people you've invited. Invites can go out via email or text message, and come in the form of a unique link. Recipients may also need a password to access your "place", which you'll have to share with them by another means. Text or email works fine, as does writing it on a napkin, shouting it across a crowded dining table, or putting it on a post-in in a shared space; these are dinner invites, not ballistic missle codes.

The last tab, Notes, is a place to share comments, links to recipes, pictures, and playlist ideas with your fellow cooks and diners. You can keep your own private notes here (ex.: "don't seat Jane and Tex together; they haven't gotten over their Bernie vs. Liz debate from last month") but it's the most fun to share meal ideas, selfies, etc. with the whole group.

Once your event is finished, you don't need to do anything - the page will stay live for everyone you previously invited, and they can continue to add notes, check recipes, or even just refresh themselves on the names they forgot in a flurry of introductions at the last meal.

The exception to this is, as the host, you can choose to have an event "recur", which lets you copy the location info + instructions and (optionally) invitee list to create a new event in the same place with at least some of the same people.

## Code of Conduct and Community Rules

This is a non-exhausive list of terms, policies, and practices applied to user activity and contributions of content to both the PTLI website(s) and open soure code.

It is signed by the following Contributors as of now (8-Nov-2019):

### Online Communication and Content

This software can be used to communicate with other people through its website and connected SMS and email gateways. As a User of the site or software, you are expected to adhere to the laws of both your jurisdiction and any recipients regarding electronic communication, including restrictions on threatening or explicit content and the sharing of private information without consent.

Furthermore, the Community of ptli.club has appointed moderators (currently the same as the Contributors listed above) to apply qualitative judgement to content posted through the site and software and remove or modify content found to be outside those standards. Users found to be knowingly and consistently running afoul of these standards will be notified and their ability to post content restricted or blocked, up to and including a block of their client IP or registered email address (or domain, in particular egregious/distributed cases).

Tl;dr: you may have the right to shout whatever nonsense you want in a public place, but that doesn't equate to the right to have that utterance amplified, archived, and legitimized by our platform.

### Moderation Feedback

If you wish to flag any site content for moderation, please use the Flag link from any site page or content block. All flagged items will be reviewed by a moderator, and you will be notified with the result of any review that occurs.

For general questions or concerns about moderation, please email [mods@ptli.club](mailto:mods@ptli.club). Messages to this list will be seen by all site moderators, and will be retained for no more than 90 days unless the original sender is notified of an intent to copy some information to the moderation log (see below).

Please do not send site credentials, personal information about other users, or additional copies of content that has already been posted and flagged to this alias. Links to pages on the ptli.club website are fine, but screenshots of alleged violating content, large attachments, or off-topic threads may be deleted without notification or reply.

### Moderation Log

Moderation decisions that result in changes to site content (elision, deletion, user bans, etc.) will be recorded in a public moderation log. Original content that is removed will _not_ be stored here or elsewhere on the servers managed by ptli.club, though it may persist in other archives outside our control.

This log can be referenced in messages to site moderators or on-site messages but it is not intended as a "meta-channel" to discuss particular moderation decisions on-site. Please take those discussions to email so we can manage recipient lists and user privacy appropriately.

### Harmful and Restricted Speech

The ptli.club website moderators may apply moderation to user-provided they find to be directing threats of harm to any user or group of people, using epithets and slurs without consideration for the receiver(s), or containing sexually explicit, violent, or falsified media.

Any calls to violence or celebration of it beyond _very_ limited scenarios like organized sporting events or appreciation of action movies and video games will result in an immediate removal of content, ban of posting users, and potential follow-up with law enforcement.

In addition, PTLI is not intended to use to solicit any commercial exchange for the meals being offered. Asking for a donation to offset the cost of a large turkey or specialized utensil being purchased for the meal is fine; soliciting Bitcoin in exchange for an invite to try your "special cookies" is frankly just weird and kind of icky so we'll probably take that down, too.

### Security

All websites, mail servers, and other services provided by ptli.club use automatically-renewed certificates from Let's Encrypt. Our servers run Ubuntu LTS and Clear Linux operating systems, sit behind software and hardware firewalls, and deploy only artifacts built by our continuous integration service. Logs go offsite, script kiddies get auto-banned, and all data is on encrypted volumes that force a password to be hand-entered when a server boots, requiring a trusted administrator to bless any new machine for access.

If you find a security issue with the ptli.club website or software, please send a GPG-signed (and optionally) encrypted message to [security@ptli.club](mailto:security@ptli.club) or use our [issue report](https://ptli.club/feedback?type=security) form.

Our GPG key for this email account is: `XXXX`.

### Content Ownership and Copyright

The ptli.club website can be used to post content of multiple types, including links to external websites, image files, and other media. Users should only post content to which they have an explicit licensed or protected use, for which they are the original author or copyright holder, or with a reasonable expectation of fair use. (Ex.: catchy image memes are okay, appropriating someone else's portrait for your avatar is not).

Posting content to this site effectively requires re-licensing it under the same Creative Commons Attribution license that the site's static content uses. If we get yanked offline because people are sharing PDF scans of their favorite cookbooks and whole album rips of their preferred meal-prep playlists it's going to be a bad day for everyone, including your dinner guests.

Content posted to the site can be deleted locally upon request by the author, or based on moderation decisions. We will honor good-faith requests to delete user data, but cannot control what search engines and other crawlers may do with previously-visible versions of the site beyond returning reasonable HTTP codes and HTML metadata for modified and deleted resources.

## FAQ

### What Does It Cost?

Nothing! The code is open source, and the current instance running on [ptli.club](https://ptli.club/) is provided at no cost to folks who want to use it according to the Code of Conduct and Community Rules, posted on the [about](https://ptli.club/about) page.

The free instance does not guarantee lifetime read/write access to all data. Based on usage and cost, we may rotate older events and updates into "cold" storage, where they will still be served as read-only resources but no further edits are possible.

### Wait, I Know the Rule About "If You Aren't Paying..."

That's a totally reasonable concern to have. Feel free to not sign up for the community site, or run your own for a fee -- we'll happily link to you here if we think you're running a good community! -- but rest assured this is not a money-making endeavour on the part of the PTLI contributors. We just think more folks should sit down for meals together because it makes the world a better place.

If we ever launch a paid service around PTLI, we promise to offer everyone the _opt-in, not -out_ chance to migrate their free public data there, and full data-retention controls in both the free and paid services. We hope and expect any other commercial sites running the same software to do the same, though we won't attempt to enforce that through weird dual-licensing (b/c honestly we think it's confusing and probably not very enforceable, anyway).

### Can I Use This For Events Other Than Meals?

Umm, probably? I mean, you're going to have a pretty bare-looking Menu in most cases...unless there are tasty homemade drinks, or art to be enjoyed, or games to be played, in which case it sounds fun and you should go for it!

Seriously, though, have you considered at least putting out some snacks for your three-hour brainstorming session with the marketing team? Brain food is important, you know.

### Is This Real?

Sort of? I have the domain, a server, and a loose bunch of code to make it go. I have an increasingly-likely-to-slip goal of "Holidays 2019" to have it running. Stay tuned.
