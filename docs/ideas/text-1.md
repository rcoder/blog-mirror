# Text is Important, Part 1

I'm writing this document using what is by any objective measure an absurd mix of technologies.

The source code for this website is mostly written in Markdown, which is increasingly typical these days but was a really weird way to build websites back in the late 90s when I first tried it out for a now long-defunct personal blog.

That code lives in a version control repository, and I update it (and the mix of JavaScript/TypeScript, shell, and editor configuration that makes it all zip along together) from an open-source editor that has fancy plugins for every one of those content types and dozens more I might touch in a normal week of computering.

Pieces of the workflow run in a command-line environment that would seem pretty familiar to the 17 year-old me who first learned Java by editing and compiling code over a telnet connection to a Solaris box on my college network. I'm using Git and SFTP to push and pull files instead of plain ol' FTP, and the computer I do my scratch work on is about 1000x more powerful in every meaningful dimension, but the basic workflow (edit code, run build, check result in terminal and then a browser) has a very familiar, very late-90s feel.

In every step of this process, of foremost importance in the work I'm doing is text. Usually monospaced, compactly-rendered, semantically color-coded...but still just pages upon pages of text.

Some of it I read as prose, some of it I puzzle over as errors, logs, or not-yet-understood code samples I find online. Some of it is tabular or tree-structured (JSON, YAML, filesystem trees); all of it relies on subtle signals of placement, color, and cadence of whitespace to signal type, state, and language.

My own text could be similarly structured according to quite a few conventions or rulesets, and processed by an almost enless number of simple filters, parsers, compilers, and post-processors to result ultimately in...more text! But this time, highly specialized text intended for web browsers to render markup, style it, and add dynamic behaviors.

I can read that text, but just barely. It isn't very interesting or fun to read: imagine a document written by lawyers, entirely for the consumption of other lawyers, who would in turn be explaining it in court to defend their own right to continue to practice law. It's pedantic and tailored to the point of near-incomprehensibility except to practitioners of a very eclectic mix of technologies developed over decades to layer on top of each other.

Along the way, my late-201X-era computer capable of displaying billions of colors and millions of pixels of information is displaying approximately as much text on-screen as a newspaper reporter or typesetter working 100 years ago might be comfortable with at any one time. Unless I'm editing sound, photos, or video, the effective "working set" of information I need close at-hand at most any time could easily fit on one of those 3D-printed "Save" icons us olds are always talking about.

All of this is made not-painful by the fact that I've effectively, over years of iteration, experimentation, and muscle memory, built up a unique argot with which to interact with my computer and my computer alone. Choosing which floppy-worth of information to make "current", safely modifying it, and rendering the result back out in archival and public forms is a metter of a few familiar commands. Entire "generations" of tools, operating systems, and coding idioms I picked up over the last 20 years still live on in a dusting of dotfiles, command aliases, editor plugins, and convenient little scripts in `~/bin` that takes up residence on any new computer I settle in to, turning it into at least a stumbling non-native speaker of my own textual I/O "langauge".

Any you know what? It feels _good_. This is how computers are supposed to work, I think: as informational toolboxes carefully filled with the collection of widgets needed for a single craftsperson's approach to their trade.
