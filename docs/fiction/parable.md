# A Parable

Once upon a time (but not so long ago in fact) there was a man who worked as a porter. His job, naturally, was to carry loads from one place to another. Over many years, he had expanded the range over which he worked and (as he got stronger and faster) the size of the loads he could carry.

One day, a group of his regular customers came to him to say they wanted to change where their goods were sold, and therefore where he should take them. Instead of selling to other merchants in their town, they had heard that better prices and more customers were to be had in the next village over, so they asked the porter if he could carry them many miles to that village.

The porter was rightfully proud of his strength and reliability, so he accepted immediately.

On the very next day when we arrived at each customer's house to pick up their goods he found the loads ever so slightly more heavy than normal. After the second stop, he began to notice the weight, but as he had promised the new route would be no problem, he carried on. By the fifth and last pickup, he was staggering under the weight, but again he smiled, said "no problem!", and shuffled to the town gates and onto the well-tread road towards the next village.

A few miles down the road, he found himself barely able to move due to the heavy weight on his shoulders. He belatedly realized that while each load was only a bit heavier than he was used to, he was carrying five of them at once and was unable to stop and drop off anything until he had gone down the long road to the next town.

Every so often, he saw someone walking easily or riding a horse on the road, and he thought of stopping them to ask if they were going the same direction and might help carry some of the load. Unfortunately, his pride would not let him ask for help, so he kept inching his way forward, his back and legs becoming heavier with each step.

Finally twilight fell, and he realized he had not even gone half the distance. With a final push and groan he tried and failed to take another step forward, and instead fell over and rolled into the ditch on the side of the road. His burden fell on top of him and he found he was too tired to even push them aside and crawl back towards the road.

That night, he was hungry, exhausted, and thirsty as he had never been in his life. In addition, he realized that one of his legs had been broken under the heavy load when he fell.

The porter began to cry, feeling sad and embarassed to have failed to make his deliveries as promised. Overcome with sadness and pain he decided to simply lie in the ditch until he expired of thirst, and began to slowly carve handfulls of dirt out from under himself to make a shallow grave.

Early in the morning, someone returning to the porter's village down the road heard him moaning and climbed down into the ditch to see what was happening. This man was in fact a long-time friend of the porter (though they hadn't seen each other in many years) and upon seeing the poor man in such dire straights he shouted, "stop that! Let me go and fetch help!" and proceeded to do just that.

Soon the healer and priest from the village came, along with several of the man's friends and even some of his clients. They gently lifted the packages from on top of him, loaded him onto a stretcher, and carried him back to the healer's house, where he was put to bed and given gentle medicines to help him sleep and heal.

After sleeping through an entire day and night, the porter pulled himself out of bed and snuck away from the healer's house, full of shame for his failure and embarassment at being seen by so many people in his downtrodden state.

He painfully made his way home, having to stop every few feet to rest and let the pain in his leg subside. Eventually he came to his front door and was shocked to see the front steps freshly swept and a curl of smoke coming out the chimney. He went inside and found everything clean and stocked as though he were expecting an important visitor. There was fresh, cold well water in his wash basin, a still-warm loaf of bread on his table, and a small fire merrily burning in the stove.

The porter was taken aback, but told himself that surely someone must have mistaken his house for their own, or perhaps come to clean in the expectation that he would soon be dead and they would be able to move in.

So he quickly washed his face, changed into clean pants and shirt, and hobbled back out to see his customers and beg forgiveness for his failures. At each visit, he told his client that he was very sorry, and would of course refund his fee and work twice as hard as soon as he healed. Each time, they turned him away with a quick nod, saying "I have no work for you today or tomorrow. Go home and I will call for you later."

By the fifth and last stop he felt nearly distraught. Not only was he sick, injured, and embarrassed, it appeared he had no livelihood to return to. Still, his pride demanded he see every wronged party to make his apologies, so he knocked on the door and entered when bidden.

His fifth client, a successful tea merchant, greeted him warmly and bade him sit down by the hearth and have a cup of tea. The porter, unsure when he would next have a warm place to sit or fine tea to enjoy, meekly accepted.

He began to make the same apologies when the merchant interrupted him. "Stop; I know you have already been to four houses and been told there is no work for you. Why you think my answer would be any different?"

At this, the proud porter finally broke down and started to cry. The tea merchant rose from his seat and went to his desk to draw out a small pouch. He returned to where the porter sat, put a gentle hand on his shoulder, and placed the bag in his lap. The porter silently consdiered the bag. He could not imagine what might be inside aside from perhaps some lightweight, value-less object even he might be fit to carry to another house nearby; in other words, a job offered out of pity.

The tea merchant then said, "I see you have mistaken my intentions as well as that of my fellows. Please, open the bag and I will explain."

The porter collected himself, wiped his nose on his sleeve, and slowly opened the draw string of the pouch and peered inside. He was shocked to discover that the pouch was full of silver coins; in fact, too many coins to quickly count. After a moment's pause, he looked up at the merchant with eyes full of confusion.

"My friend, the reason we have no work for you today or tomorrow is that we all wish for you to rest and recover, not work yourself into an early grave. We cannot undo the harm we did by piling load after load onto your back with little concern for your health, and so we will pay you each week as though you had worked each day to your utmost. When you have healed, we will pool our resources to buy you a barrow and mule so you can carry our goods to the next village without pain. We only hope you will forgive us for the hurt you have suffered for our sake."

At this, the porter was again lost for words. He sat for several minutes staring at the fire, occasionally looking up and raising his hand as if to speak, then lowering it and saying nothing. Again the tea merchant spoke and said, "go home now, my friend. We will have supper sent to you soon, and the healer will check on you in the morning to make sure your leg is healing well. You gave him quite a shock when he woke up to find you gone, and we all want you mended as soon as possible."

The porter returned home, and after many days of convalescence he found himself able to walk comfortably around the village with no pain. He went back to work the next day, picking up the day's parcels in his new barrow. Then he walked alongside his mule all the way to the next village. When he arrived he found he still had half the day to spare, so he spent some time carrying children and people struggling under their own burdens around town before walking home.

Many more days passed like this. Some were harder than others, and indeed it was not the last time the porter promised to do more than was reasonable and failed to complete his charter. However, he never forgot the kindness of his community and never again despaired of being able to find work or carry himself with pride.
