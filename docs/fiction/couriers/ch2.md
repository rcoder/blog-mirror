# Chapter 2

> Location: Golden Gate Bridge Ferry Terminal

I woke up sore and tired, and downed the last of my trail aspirin[^1] before I even had breakfast. K showed no sign of wanting to discuss the previous evenings display of martial prowess, so we packed and saddled up in near-silence.

After that, I didn't get a lot of satisfaction out of being right about how much of a slog riding the remaining few km into SF turned out to be the next morning. We rolled up to the ferry launch a bit before the lunchtime commute barge was expected back, so I killed time browsing messages and starting the search for my next batch of deliveries.

Unsurprisingly, I had more than one dispatcher refusing to schedule me on any routes until I had successfully dumped my current batch in the city, so there wasn't much to do aside from grouse briefly to a few friends over regular gossip messages about my poor missing epidermis and go for a walk to warm back up before the long, windy boat trip across the Golden Gate.

Since I was wanted in SF ASAP, I at least didn't have to pick up any local service gigs just to get a good spot in the priority queue for the boat. I'd be able to leave at noon, even if my berth was steerage (read: standing-room only in a windowless hold) class.

Since my bike was already packed and handed off to the baggers, I set off for the steep trail that marked the old bridgehead with just my slate and an energy bar in my pack. Stopping at a marked viewpoint, I scanned the plaque I'd glanced over so many times marking the site of the long-lost Golden Gate Bridge, which the big quake of '29 took down along with the Bay Bridge and most of the residential housing inventory up and down the Bay.

Just then my slate pinged to tell me a priority-coded sender had reached me over the line-of-site links back to SF. When I looked at the message summary I could hardly believe it. One of my clients was refusing delivery on grounds of a critical QoS failure, and I felt a sinking feeling as I realized they had re-coded the delivery while I was in the no-coverage zone in the Redwoods, marking a hard deadline for arrival that I had just missed.

It was annoying to be sure, but anyone so eager to get their data would probably have bid for redudant carrier attempts anyway. I had very little concern about the delivery getting through -- that was what our baroque network of human and animal carriers, line-of-site links, and microwave skip antennas was _for_ after all -- but getting preemptively told there'd be no payout for mt attempt despite my injury left me feeling grumpy and unappreciated.

After one more long, sour-faced look over the cloud-dusted sky between me and the green-and-gray mottled skyline of SF I turned back towards the ferry terminal, determined to salvage what little reputation and payment I could from this adventure.

I ran into K waiting for the same boat, so we sat down for a cup of tea and some complementary almonds handed out with a Central Valley ag coop marketing pitch from the fresh-faced volunteers in the departure lounge. Hospitality was considered essential at major pit stops like this, but no one was above finding a little sponsorship to offset the cost of the light provisions being handed out.

Since he was my only immediately-available audience, I groused a bit about my already-cancelled delivery, which I expected him to acknowledge briefly and then avoid talking about, because what's less interesting than someone else's un-solveable work problem? Instead, he immediately perked up, leaned towards me across the table, and pressed for details on the delivery order, SLA rules, etc.

"Why the sudden interest in my running gigs, man? We've been riding together for three days and this is the first time you've seemed to care. You obviously know how to handle yourself out there on the trail so I can't believe I'm the first courier you could have asked about this stuff."

K replied, "Look, we're about to get into town so I may as well tell you. Me running in to you on the road wasn't a total accident. I volunteer with a group that keeps an eye out for, well, let's call them 'hot' data packages making their way around off the shared 'nets using courier routes like yours. I was watching for someone coming down the coast route with an interesting delivery just as you rolled through, and decided to tag along to see if my info was any good. I sure I was on the wrong track until you told me folks were already breathing down your neck for the delivery even though you were just a few hours behind schedule; now, I'm less sure."

This confession did little to improve my mood, so I lashed out a bit. "What, you're some kind of freaking _Ranger_ out here looking for threats to the network and everything? How flattering you'd be interested in little ol' me. Regardless, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm just hauling normal, boring data and docs today. No secret worms, emergent AI, or viral payloads hanging out in my sad assortment of personal packages."

"I *hate* that word," K shot back. "Some Tolkein fan decided 50 years ago that it sounded way more romantic to name their janitorial job after a mythical band of heroes instead of calling us sysadmins, or maintenance workers, or IT drones...any of the terms that would have applied then _and_ now without the stupid expectations and bigoted, male-power-fantasy trappings."
