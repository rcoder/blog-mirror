# Chapter 2

> Location: Golden Gate Bridge Ferry Terminal

I woke up sore and tired, and downed the last of my trail aspirin[^1] before I even had breakfast. K showed no sign of wanting to discuss the previous evenings display of martial prowess, so we packed and saddled up in near-silence.

After that, I didn't get a lot of satisfaction out of being right about how much of a slog riding the remaining few km into SF turned out to be the next morning. We rolled up to the ferry launch a bit before the lunchtime commute barge was expected back, so I killed time browsing messages and starting the search for my next batch of deliveries.

Unsurprisingly, I had more than one dispatcher refusing to schedule me on any routes until I had successfully dumped my current batch in the city, so there wasn't much to do aside from grouse briefly to a few friends over regular gossip messages about my poor missing epidermis and go for a walk to warm back up before the long, windy boat trip across the Golden Gate.

Since I was wanted in SF ASAP, I at least didn't have to pick up any local service gigs just to get a good spot in the priority queue for the boat. I'd be able to leave at noon, even if my berth was steerage (read: standing-room only in a windowless hold) class.

Since my bike was already packed and handed off to the baggers, I set off for the steep trail that marked the old bridgehead with just my slate and an energy bar in my pack. Stopping at a marked viewpoint, I scanned the plaque I'd glanced over so many times marking the site of the long-lost Golden Gate Bridge, which the big quake of '29 took down along with the Bay Bridge and most of the residential housing inventory up and down the Bay.

Just then my slate pinged to tell me a priority-coded sender had reached me over the line-of-site links back to SF. When I looked at the message summary I could hardly believe it. One of my clients was refusing delivery on grounds of a critical QoS failure, and I felt a sinking feeling as I realized they had re-coded the delivery while I was in the no-coverage zone in the Redwoods, marking a hard deadline for arrival that I had just missed.

It was annoying to be sure, but anyone so eager to get their data would probably have bid for redudant carrier attempts anyway. I had very little concern about the delivery getting through -- that was what our baroque network of human and animal carriers, line-of-site links, and microwave skip antennas was _for_ after all -- but getting preemptively told there'd be no payout for mt attempt despite my injury left me feeling grumpy and unappreciated.

After one more long, sour-faced look over the cloud-dusted sky between me and the green-and-gray mottled skyline of SF I turned back towards the ferry terminal, determined to salvage what little reputation and payment I could from this adventure.
