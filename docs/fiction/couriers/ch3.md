# Chapter 3

I ran into K waiting for the same boat, so we sat down for a cup of tea and some complementary almonds handed out with a Central Valley ag coop marketing pitch from the fresh-faced volunteers in the departure lounge. Hospitality was considered essential at major pit stops like this, but no one was above finding a little sponsorship to offset the cost of the light provisions being handed out.

Since he was my only immediately-available audience, I groused a bit about my already-cancelled delivery, which I expected him to acknowledge briefly and then avoid talking about, because what's less interesting than someone else's un-solveable work problem? Instead, he immediately perked up, leaned towards me across the table, and pressed for details on the delivery order, SLA rules, etc.

"Why the sudden interest in my running gigs, man? We've been riding together for three days and this is the first time you've seemed to care. You obviously know how to handle yourself out there on the trail so I can't believe I'm the first courier you could have asked about this stuff."

K replied, "Look, we're about to get into town so I may as well tell you. Me running in to you on the road wasn't a total accident. I volunteer with a group that keeps an eye out for, well, let's call them 'hot' data packages making their way around off the shared 'nets using courier routes like yours. I was watching for someone coming down the coast route with an interesting delivery just as you rolled through, and decided to tag along to see if my info was any good. I sure I was on the wrong track until you told me folks were already breathing down your neck for the delivery even though you were just a few hours behind schedule; now, I'm less sure."

This confession did little to improve my mood, so I lashed out a bit. "What, you're some kind of freaking _Ranger_ out here looking for threats to the network and everything? How flattering you'd be interested in little ol' me. Regardless, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm just hauling normal, boring data and docs today. No secret worms, emergent AI, or viral payloads hanging out in my sad assortment of personal packages."

"I *hate* that word," K shot back. "Some Tolkein fan decided 50 years ago that it sounded way more romantic to name their janitorial job after a mythical band of heroes instead of calling us sysadmins, or maintenance workers, or IT drones...any of the terms that would have applied then _and_ now without the stupid expectations and bigoted, male-power-fantasy trappings."
