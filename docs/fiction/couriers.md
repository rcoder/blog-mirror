# Chapter 1

> Location: Coast Highway, 40km North of San Francisco City

I lost traction taking a hairpin left turn and just subtly tapping the brakes when the rider in front of me did the same. Unfortunately my slick, narrow long-distance-hauling tires didn't have the grip patch his chunky mountain bike rubber did and I completely lost control of my bike. I ended up getting a ride underneath it all the way from the weather-eroded center lane marker to the barely-hanging-on guardrail, coming to an abrupt undignified stop in a cloud of gravel dust and small mountain of camping gear, sealed message tubes, and high-viz cross-spectrum flashing LEDs.[^1]

K stopped at the bottom of the curve and subvocal-texted "u okay?" while I picked myself up, wincing from the road rash now covering my left side from waistband of my (now entirely trashed) riding shorts to the outside of my calf. My helmet slowly deflated around my collarbone and the back of my neck, leaving me feeling dirty, bruised, and lucky to not be contemplating nothingness for a few more seconds before smashing myself to pieces on the rocks below.

"Need a sec. Ow." I replied, taking a moment to pull out my first aid kid and mapping slate to a) clean myself up, and b) record the expected delay in my travel log so the folks waiting on my deliveries would get an updated ETA and adjust their plans (and further routing of those messages) accordingly.[^2]

Some numbness-and-cold-in-a-can from the first aid bag, a big handful of clean bandages, and a roadside change into my camp shorts later I was ready to start pedaling again. I caught K just finishing an energy bar and getting ready to start up the next hill as I coasted down and took it easy on the climb, waiting for my muscles to warm while he caught up.

We weren't riding together due to any long acquaintance or shared purpose; I had just run into him when I was finishing a short day's ride in the early afternoon before the last big hill of my route, and he convinced me to ride on with him providing encouragement so I could arrive in SF early, or take an extra day once we came down off the cliffs and found good oceanfront camping.

Both ideas were more appealing to me than another evening spent by myself, finishing a book in the rapidly-fading light of my solar-powered riding lights and trying to remember what talking to another person felt like. Thus began three days of riding together, pushing each other to make a few more miles a little faster than either of us would likely have done alone.

It had been a great bit of mutually-beneficial competition until my blunder and the subsequent evaporation of any early-arrival bonus. Now I'd be lucky to limp in the the city on the extreme end of my delivery SLA, leaving me with an irritated local network of dispatchers on whom I would depend for my next gig.

So now I was looking at a limping, painful ride back into the city with bags full of deliveries that were going to start developing exactly the kind of latent "ripeness" that folks paid extra to _avoid_ when hiring a courier instead of waiting for ambient network gossip to hand off their payloads eventually.[^3]

By the next regular campsite a few km down the road, I had pulled well ahead of K -- those skinny tired were good for _something_, it turned out -- so I took the gravel "exit ramp" to the off-season campground and texted him that I was done for the day. I remembered this camp having a good first aid cache and a narrow line-of-sight to a Marin repeater that would let me clean up, squirt my delivery updates to the waiting clients, and get some rest before I finished out the ride tomorrow.

Unsurprisingly, K decided to bag it in early too and joined me just as my slate's radio finished handshaking and gossiping away with the repeater. I didn't even bother looking at my incoming messages, since there wasn't anything I could do other than keep pedaling and finish the job until I was back in civilization.

We settled into what had become an easy camp routine: I fired up the biofuel stove and started heating the kettle for tea; he did a quick forage of the woods near our camp and scored a few fresh Chanterelles to add to our reheated rice and veggies. We were eating everything we could that contained its own water at this point to avoid hauling heavy perishables into the city where they'd be cheap and easy to replenish.

After dinner as the light started failing we were settling in to our hammocks for the night when something growled and snapped some branches on the ground nearby. Next thing I knew, K was out of his hammock and hauling ass behind the tree closest to where his toes had been after picking up his backpack from the ground below him.

[^1]: My lights hit the full range from 400-700nm every second with intensity going up and down out-of-phase at 1/2-speed, but never losing the high-intensity core elements that decode quickly to my primary working public key. If you can ignore them, your eyes (mushy and water-filled or made of high-speed CMOS detectors) need to be checked. We don't take stupid chances on the open highway, beyond the stupid chance of being there in the first place.

[^2]: Gear that works well for weeks and months spent on the road is a special kind of the random hodgepodge of salvage, homebrew tech, and slightly-above-iron-age manufacturing we out here on the coast live and die by. There are still a few factories and fabs turning out batteries, cheap LCDs, and embedded processors like they did in the first three decades of the century, but without the enthusiastic Western economy to demand ever newer and slicker technology, things have settled into a slower rate of change. These days a "generation" of tech was expected to last years if not decades in the field being actually used hard by folks like K and me.

[^3]: These days you could expect a normal round-trip for simple text of up to a few hundred kilochars to be a couple of days, not entirely unlike the days of the Pony Express a couple of hundred years prior. If you had more data to pass, or wanted to make sure it reached a particular recipient without a bunch of fragmentation and missed checksums potentially multiplying the wait by 5-10x, you hired me and my compatriots. Our end-to-end latency couldn't compete with the symbiotic mesh network everyone else relied on for basic connectivity, but we could haul an entire pile of flash memory, high-res printouts, or specialized parts and chemical samples too hard to just print on-site.
