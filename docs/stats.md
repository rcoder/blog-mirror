# Site Stats

This page is periodically generated from my site access logs[^1]. While I can't stop your browser from reporting its IP, detailed user agent, and other deliciously-fingerprint-able data, I can at least refuse to pay any attention to it and instead build a simple leaderboard based on filtered HTTP requests.

[^1]: TODO: link to mirror of actual stats-generating code. It's in the repo.
