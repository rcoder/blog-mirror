This site is the work of [Lennon Day-Reynolds](http://rcoder.net/).

If you want to get in touch, [email](mailto:lennon@rcoder.net) works well. You could also try [twitter](https://twitter.com/rcoder) or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/rcoder) if you want to talk about something business-y or internet random and don't like email, I guess?

(Expect better tools here soon.)

You can find me on a number of other websites as `@rcoder` (ex.: [twitter](https://twitter.com/rcoder/), [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/rcoder/), etc.) though I'm trying to focus my actual creative output here for the time being.

I have a [resume](ldr-resume.md) stashed somewhere around here.
