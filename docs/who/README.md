# Who's Here?

![me](/images/photoroll/DSCF0779.jpg)

This site is the work of [Lennon Day-Reynolds](http://rcoder.net/).

You can find me on a number of other websites as `@rcoder` (ex.: [twitter](https://twitter.com/rcoder/), [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/rcoder/), etc.) though I'm trying to focus my actual creative output here for the time being.

I have a [resume](ldr-resume.md) stashed somewhere around here.

You can reach out on the [contact](/contact/) page.
